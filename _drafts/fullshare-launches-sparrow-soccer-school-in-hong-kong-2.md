<p>Co-head of Investment Department of Fullshare, Mr. Jonathan Broughton stated that, “We pay close attention to the developmental needs of children. We cherished the opportunity to partner with SKH St. Christopher’s Home and hope their children enjoyed the live sporting event atmosphere, which is an experience that we hope can continue to inspire and motivate them.
