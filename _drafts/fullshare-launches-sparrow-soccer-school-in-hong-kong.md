<p>(27 June 2018 – Australia) Fullshare Holdings Limited (“Fullshare”) kicked off its partnership with FC Internazionale Milano (“Inter Milan”) by launching Inter Academy Australia, the first Inter Milan football academy located in Australia, targeted at kids aged 3 to 15 years old.</p>

<p>Inter Milan, an Italian Serie A Club and 3-times UEFA Champions League winner, has designated Fullshare and Sparrow Early Learning (“Sparrow”) as its Official Education Partner.

Sparrow is one of Australia’s leading early education and care providers offering a high-quality learning and nurturing program in beautiful facilities led by caring and qualified educators. Sparrow is committed to guiding and encouraging each child through their early years to have unique and meaningful experiences.</p>

<p>Sparrow will provide children the opportunity to participate in the Inter Academy offerings in Australia, which includes soccer classes at Sparrow locations, after school soccer classes, soccer classes during vacation care and holiday soccer camps. Sparrow will partner with the Brisbane Roar FC Community Team who will provide technical assistance to Inter Academy Australia in Queensland. The Brisbane Roar FC Community Team would cooperate with Sparrow to deliver Inter Academy’s trusted curriculum at locations across Queensland.</p>

<p>The event was attended by Inter Chief Communication and Marketing Officer, Robert Faulkner, and Inter Academy coach Andrea Ratti, both of whom met with guests and the press, accompanying them during the launch. The group from Inter visited one of Sparrow’s centres in Brisbane and were impressed by the quality of the facilities and the eagerness of the children to participate in Inter Academy Australia.</p>

<p>“_This is a very significant partnership for both companies” said Inter’s Robert Faulkner during the presentation, “as it allows our Club to reach new countries with huge potential via our experienced coaches and using our unique and trusted coaching method of the Inter Academy. Thanks to the support of Sparrow, our local partner in the Asia Pacific region, we will roll-out this model quickly across Australia, and beyond in the near future._”</p>

**<p>Co-head of Investment Department at Fullshare, Mr. Jonathan Broughton** highlighted that, “_Fullshare is proud to unveil the first Inter Academy offering in Australia as part of Fullshare’s expanding presence in the education and tourism sectors of Australia. We are already looking forward to expanding Inter Academy’s presence in Australia for children aged 3 to 15 years old and promoting sports education and a healthy lifestyle. We look forward to children joining the Sparrow family and participating in the upcoming Inter Academy Australia events._”</p>

**<p>CEO of Sparrow, Mr. John Bairstow** commented that: “_What children learn in the early years has a profound and dramatic impact on their entire life. Countless independent studies have found that teaching children the importance of sport and healthy living improves the quality and duration of their lives and the community in which they live. We are extremely honored to have this opportunity to work with one of Europe’s leading football clubs, which shares our passion of improving the lives of young people. This project will not only teach children about the benefits of playing this beautiful sport but expand their cultural awareness through getting closer to the Nerazzurri world and European football. We look forward to working successful with Inter on this project to inspire the next generation of Matildas and Socceroos._”</p>
