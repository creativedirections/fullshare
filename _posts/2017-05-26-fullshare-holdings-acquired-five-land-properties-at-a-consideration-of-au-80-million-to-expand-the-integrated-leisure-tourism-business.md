Mr. Ji Changqun, Executive Director, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Fullshare Holdings said: “The Group is actively promoting healthy living and sustainable development. Through the five business platforms namely new tourism, healthcare, property, new energy and investment, the Group is endeavored to create green and healthy life-style to consumers. According to the report “China’s Middle Class in Next Decade”(《下一個十年的中國中產階級》) issued by McKinsey & Company, by 2022, 76% of the PRC urban households will reach the middle class income standard, and annual disposable income of these Chinese households would fall in the range of RMB60,000 to RMB229,000 by that time. The rapid increase in China’s middle class and gradual shifting in consumption pattern has fueled the development of tourism industry. This emerging industry is also one of the Group’s major focus.”

"Fullshare is vigorously integrating high-qualitied tourism resources to create a comprehensive leisure tourism platform. Since the acquisition of Laguna and Sheraton projects in Australia in 2016, we have once again acquired 5 premium land properties in Australia as well as a tourism property management company. The acquisition and the consolidation of the relevant land resources will provide a solid foundation for the Group's tourism projects such as the development of suburban vacation resorts and cultural towns. As a conglomerate with global vision, we will continue to build a high-end tourism resort combining healthy-living, entertainment and leisure projects, aiming to provide quality life-style for the public.” Mr. Ji added. “The acquisition also demonstrates the Group’s long-term investment strategy in Australia.”
